 *
 * Operation:
 *  Code is used to move autonomous vehicle along black taped path. Whilst the
 *  the car is off the line it will spin in a circle until it finds the path.
 *  Code works with conjunction with.
 *	
 *	IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure to calibrate the line sensors before make any edits to the code. The sensors show a red light when over white and are otherwise considered to be over black.
 *
 * Hardware:
 *  Inputs:
 *    line following sensors (VCC,GND,SIG) x4  -> PA.0 - PA.3 -> Pins 22-25
 *  Outputs:
 *    DC motors(VCC,GND,sig1-3) x2  PWM -> PE.3 & PH.3 -> Pins 5 & 6
 *                    Dir - > PL.0-> Pins 49
